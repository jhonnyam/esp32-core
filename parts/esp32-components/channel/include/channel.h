// Channels are objects which enable iteration over other Channel objects with
// the same name/identifier.
// This implementation resembles a map, mapping identifiers to lists. 
// Channels are implemented as an item of two separate lists.
// The "unique" list holds items with different identifiers,
// the "same" list holds items that share the same identifier. 
// Each list item itself is a valid list containing only itself;
// multiple items can be combined to a larger list.
// 
// This implementation constructs a single valid "unique" list,
// starting with a globally defined root node. All "same" lists of all items
// are considered valid.
//
// Adding to this structure implies iterating the "unique" list, until either
// the same identifier is found (and the new item is added to the "same" list
// of the found item) or the end of the "unique" list reached (and it's
// appended as new "unique" list item).
//
// Each added Channel object is now part of a "same" list which can be directly
// iterated to find other items.
//
// exemplary structure:
// 
//              root node---.  O        O
//                          v  |        |
// unique identifier list-> O--O--O--O--O  
//                             |     |
//                             O     O
//                             ^
//      same identifier list---'                    
//
// Each Channel object contains a context pointer, two callback functions (blocking/nonblocking) and
// an additional flags field. A broadcast function is provided to iterate
// through all "same" list items of a Channel object. The callbacks are issued
// with a data pointer and a timeout value (if blocking) by the caller and the callee
// specific context and flags. This interface is intended to enable dynamic
// management of FreeRTOS queues, where a queue can be registered as a context
// of a Channel and therefore fed by the Channels callback.
